## 🧭 Your Skin Recovery Plan (Zero Money, 100% Natural)

Let’s go back to basics — no store-bought products.
Just **cleaning**, **protection**, and **natural care** using **things from your kitchen**.

---

## 🌞 MORNING ROUTINE (Every Day)

### 🧼 Step 1: Wash your face (gently)

**What to use**: Just clean, room-temperature water

**How to do it**:

1. Splash clean water on your face 3–4 times.
2. Use your clean hands (not cloth or scrub) to gently move water around your face — forehead, cheeks, chin, nose.
3. Don’t rub hard.
4. Pat dry with a **clean towel** (use a separate towel just for your face).

> 🔸 **Do this every morning**, even if you didn’t go outside.

### 🌤 Step 2: Protect your skin from the sun

**Why**: Sun makes your skin darker and damages it slowly over time.

**How to do it if you don’t have sunscreen**:

1. **Cover your face** with a **cotton cloth** or **thin scarf** when going outside.
2. Walk in the **shade** when possible.
3. Avoid strong sun between **11 AM and 4 PM** if you can.
